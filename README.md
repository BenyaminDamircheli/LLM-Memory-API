# Description

This is a fun little side project I'm working on to try and build a better memory API for LLMs compared to competitors that already exist out there like Mem0 and SuperMemory. These APIs and SDKs are rigid in my opinion. Memory isn't just for user facing agents (ex. cursor agent). There are a lot of other applications for LLM memory like email processing with AI agents that don't really work with these existing APIs. I'm trying to make this as flexible as possible but remove a lot of the busy work that goes into making something like this from scratch.

Definitely still a work in progress. I don't know if I'll actually finish it, but I'm enjoying working on it so far.
